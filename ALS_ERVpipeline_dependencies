Requirements: 

KCL Rosalind account. 

1) Miniconda installation: 

SSH into rosalind: 

ssh k.....@login.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk 

Copy, paste and run the following commands into the command line (change the path to an actual directory): 

wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /PATH TO WHERE YOU WANT MINICONDA TO BE SAVED 

In the first directory where you are automatically sent when logging into Rosalind there should be a file called .bashrc 
(to check, use command ‘ls –l –a’ (while in the first directory)). 

Open .bashrc using the command ‘nano .bashrc’ and copy and paste the following two lines at the bottom of the file 
(again change the paths so that they map to Miniconda bin and Miniconda pkgs).  

export PATH=/PATH TO MINICONDA2/Miniconda2/bin:$PATH  
export PYTHONPATH=/PATH TO MINCONDA2/Miniconda2/pkgs/ 

Finally, install conda ‘channels’, In the command line copy, paste and run the following commands: 

(it doesn’t matter in which directory you are currently in when you run them) 

conda config --add channels defaults 

conda config --add channels bioconda 

conda config --add channels conda-forge 

Now to install new software (e.g. samtools), simply type the following: 

(again, it doesn’t matter what directory you are in, miniconda knows where to store the downloads). 

conda install samtools

2) Retroseq installation: 

Move to a directory where you want Retroseq to be installed (e.g. brc_scratch). 

Clone Retroseq into this directory: 

git clone https://github.com/tk2/RetroSeq.git 

There are three main dependencies for Retroseq which can be loaded from Rosalind and conda, the following code should be included in a script before Retroseq.pl is called: 

module load bioinformatics/samtools/0.1.19 

module load bioinformatics/bedtools2/2.25.0 

Exonerate should be installed using conda install (see above).

3) Repeatmasker installation: 

Although Repeatmasker can be installed via minconda, when I used this method it did not install properly, 
here is the manual installation that did work: 

3a) install HMMER: 

Quick installation instructions  

Download hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz from http://hmmer.org/; unpack it: 

wget ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz  

tar xf hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz 

cd hmmer-3.1b1  

If you have downloaded a variant ‘with binaries’, the pre-compiled binaries are found in the directory ./binaries. 
You may copy these into a directory of your choosing, or simply run them from here 
(for example, by adding this directory to your PATH variable). 
If you have downloaded the HMMER source code, you’ll need to compile the software with configure and make:  

(it is important that you are in the hmmer directory that contains the configure and make executable files) 

 ./configure  

./make  

To compile and run a test suite to make sure all is well, you can optionally do:  

./make check  

All these tests should pass. 

These instructions are directly copied from http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/Userguide.pdf

3b) install TRF 

conda install TRF 

3c) install Repeatmasker: 

Download a zipped .tar file from http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html 

Copy the file into the desired directory and unpack it using the following commands: 

gunzip RepeatMasker-open-4-#-#.tar.gz 

tar xvf RepeatMasker-open-4-#-#.tar 

 

Optionally, you can include the repbase library of DNA repeat elements, this requires a repbase account that can take a day to be 
authorised, obtained from following site: 

https://www.girinst.org/accountservices/register.php 

From girinst.org, download the repeatmasker specific repbase data set e.g.  RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-20181026.tar.gz 

Copy this file into the RepeatMasker directory that was created when you unpacked RepeatMasker in the previous step.  

Now, unpack the repbase library as before.  

gunzip RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar.gz 

tar xvf RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar 

rm RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar 


(this time the tar file is removed after unpacking is complete. The files will be automatically be put in the right place as 
long as the library is opened in the correct directory (e.g. ~/brc_scratch/RepeatMasker). 

Finally, Repeatmasker needs to be ‘configured’.  

Go to the RepeatMasker directory and run the configure executable file: 

module load general/perl/5.22.0 

Perl ./configure 

This will start a configuration progress where you will be asked to specify the locations of hmmer and perl etc. Perl is downloaded with conda and hmmer will be wherever you stored it. I quit the configuration process by closing the command line window multiple times while I figured out exactly what I needed to do with no problems – so it seems safe to quit half way through if you need to check the locations of certain files.
